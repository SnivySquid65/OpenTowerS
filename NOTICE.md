So. If you're reading this, you probably know what I'm about to talk about.
# My Stance
## About Tour De Pizza
They make cool game I think. I don't know if I'll be really into Woon, but it seems cool ig.
## About the Pizza Tower Community
Welp, I'm a part of this community now, so I guess I should say something about that. Its not bad, theres a lot of creative people in the community, I just have fun playing mods and stuff.
## About Lila
Meh, at the end of it all, I was never really involved. I feel like its possible that not ALL of the allegations against her were true, but I've also seen some pretty solid evidence of poor behavior from her. Doesn't matter now, shes moved on and is under a new alias. I hope she can improve as a person in the future.
# Final Thoughts
I like Pizza Tower. Its an okay game. Yeah.
