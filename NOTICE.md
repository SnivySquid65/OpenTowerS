So. If you're reading this, you probably know what I'm about to talk about. It makes me uncomfortable, but I have to so I hopefully don't get doxxed by someone.
# My Stance
## About Tour De Pizza
While I personally haven't seen any hate from them, just being a happy mod player and game enjoyer, I can't really say much.
I love Pizza Tower as a game, but knowing that they may have hurt others makes me hesitant on involving myself in their future endeavors.
## About the Pizza Tower Community
I've seen the good, I've seen the bad. I'll admit, outsider looking in, its scary. They make mods, some better, some worse. They make art, some better, some worse. They have interactions amongst each other, some better, some worse.
I'm making this to hopefully upkeep the only real decomp of the game, not enter the crowd.

My only word as of now to the Pizza Tower Community is to please leave me alone, don't provoke me, and don't doxx me.
## About Lila
I don't think Lila deserved every bit of hate she recieved. It was definitely a back and forth issue that led to all of this. If anyone "won" this whole thing, its the Pizza Tower Community. "Congrats! You bullied and doxxed someone into leaving your community! BONUS! You ruined their childhood! Yay!" You probably know who I side with through all of this.

Lila, if you're reading this, I'm sorry about every bit of hate you recieved. I was there watching in the background for a while. I hope you can move on from this and live a life you enjoy. As for this, I hope you can understand that me making this is nothing to do with you, and that I just want to "finish" this. Upkeep and make a wiki for it, what it needs to be future proof.
I hope you find better people and keep yourself in good shape.

# Final Thoughts
I think thats about it. I really just want to do this for fun, make a cool thing future proof, and let people do as they will with it. Okay, I'm done. I think I'm gonna go install proxmox with my friend now.
