So. If you're reading this, you probably know what I'm about to talk about.
# My Stance
## About Tour De Pizza
They make cool game I think. I don't know if I'll be really into Woon, but it seems cool ig.
## About the Pizza Tower Community
Welp, I'm a part of this community now, so I guess I should say something about that. Its not bad, theres a lot of creative people in the community, I just have fun playing mods and stuff.
## About Lu (aka. Lila)
She kinda sucked. Now she's gone, no reason for me to really think on it much now.
## Continuing OpenTower
Nah. I'm done. OpenTower's mid, and Pizza Tower EXtracted is so much better. I'm not going to bother updating this again. I'll be archiving it, so people can do whatever they want still, but just know I'm not going to help. ...Not that I really could in the first place.
# Final Thoughts
I like Pizza Tower. Its an okay game. Yeah.
